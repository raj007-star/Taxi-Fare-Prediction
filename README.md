## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taxi-fare-prediction.git
cd taxi-fare-prediction

1) Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install dependencies:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

1) Run the application:
python app.py

The application should now be running locally at http://localhost:5000.

## Usage
Enter the pickup and dropoff locations along with other parameters.
Click the "Estimate Fare" button to get the predicted taxi fare.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found in the data directory. It includes historical taxi trip data used for training the machine learning model.


##Model Training
The machine learning model used for fare prediction is implemented in the train_model.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. You can explore this notebook for details on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and training.
